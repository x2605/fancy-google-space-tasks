# Privacy
- **NOT SENDING INFORMATION ELSEWHERE:**  
  This extension does not send any information to paths other than those utilized by the original Tasks page.

- **ACCESSING ONLY FORMS WHICH USER CAN ACCESS VISIBLY:**  
  The maximum this extension can do is read existing content in Tasks, and then fill out forms or click original buttons on the original Tasks page on behalf of the user, without direct user input.

- **MODIFYING ONLY VISUAL STATE OF ORIGINAL PAGE:**  
  It only uses CSS to hide parts of the Original UI and display the Custom UI, fills out forms that users could originally input, and clicks buttons that users could originally click. It does not modify the original page in any other way that would interfere with its core functionality.

- **NOT EXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES:**  
  It does not exploit vulnerabilities to implement features.

- **NOT COLLECTING INFORMATIONS:**  
  It does not collect anonymous information, even for code maintenance.

- **EVERYTHING HAPPENS LOCALLY:**  
  Everything happens solely within the browser. The extension itself does not directly communicate with the internet, except for accessing the user's profile picture once to determine their theme color.

- **OPEN SOURCE:**  
  Code is served in a readable, uncompiled form. You can check everything.
